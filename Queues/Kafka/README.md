## What is Kafka?
Apache Kafka is a distributed data streaming platform that can publish, subscribe to, store, and process streams of records in real time. It is designed to handle data streams from multiple sources and deliver them to multiple consumers. In short, it moves massive amounts of dataâ€”not just from point A to B, but from points A to Z and anywhere else you need, all at the same time.
